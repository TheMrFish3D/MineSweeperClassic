# Next Steps for Minesweeper Classic Development

This document outlines the next steps and improvements that can be made to the Minesweeper Classic game. The basic game is fully functional, but there are several enhancements that would make it even better.

## Current Status ‚úÖ

The following features have been implemented and are working:

- ‚úÖ Complete game logic with mine placement and cell operations
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform Tkinter GUI that recreates Windows 3.11 appearance
- ‚úÖ All three standard difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)
- ‚úÖ Timer and mine counter displays
- ‚úÖ Left-click to reveal, right-click to flag functionality
- ‚úÖ Win/lose detection and game state management
- ‚úÖ Menu system with New Game and difficulty selection
- ‚úÖ Proper project structure with modular design
- ‚úÖ Documentation and setup files

## Priority 1: Essential Improvements üî•

### 1. Sound Effects
Add classic Windows sounds:
- **File**: `minesweeper/audio/sounds.py`
- **Implementation**: Use `pygame.mixer` or `playsound` library
- **Sounds needed**: 
  - Cell reveal click
  - Mine explosion
  - Flag placement
  - Game win sound
- **Settings**: Allow users to toggle sound on/off

### 2. High Score System
Implement time-based high scores:
- **File**: Extend `minesweeper/utils/__init__.py`
- **Features**:
  - Track best times for each difficulty
  - Display high scores in a dialog
  - Save/load from file
  - Add "Best Times" menu option

### 3. Custom Game Dialog
Allow users to set custom board dimensions:
- **File**: `minesweeper/gui/dialogs.py`
- **Features**:
  - Input fields for width, height, and mine count
  - Validation (max 30x24, min 9x9, reasonable mine ratios)
  - Add "Custom..." menu option
  - Remember last custom settings

## Priority 2: Enhanced Features üéØ

### 4. Middle-Click Chord Function
Implement middle-click to reveal adjacent cells:
- **Location**: Update `minesweeper/gui/__init__.py`
- **Logic**: If a numbered cell has the correct number of flags around it, reveal all remaining adjacent cells
- **Safety**: Only works when flag count matches the number

### 5. First-Click Safety
Ensure first click never hits a mine:
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Already implemented in game logic
- **Enhancement**: Make sure first click also doesn't reveal a number (clear area)

### 6. Improved Visual Polish
Enhance the Windows 3.11 appearance:
- **Graphics**: Replace emoji with proper bitmap images for mines/flags
- **Colors**: Fine-tune the color scheme to exactly match Windows 3.11
- **Fonts**: Use bitmap fonts if available
- **3D Effects**: Improve button beveling and shadows

### 7. Keyboard Shortcuts
Add keyboard navigation:
- **Keys**: F2 (new game), arrow keys (navigation), spacebar (reveal), F (flag)
- **Implementation**: Add key bindings to main window
- **Accessibility**: Improve game accessibility

## Priority 3: Advanced Features üöÄ

### 8. Game Statistics
Track detailed game statistics:
- **Metrics**: Games played, won, lost, win percentage, average time
- **File**: `minesweeper/stats.py`
- **Display**: Statistics dialog in Help menu

### 9. Hint System
Provide gameplay hints:
- **Basic**: Highlight cells that are definitely safe
- **Advanced**: Show cells that can be logically deduced
- **Implementation**: Add hint analysis to game logic

### 10. Replay System
Record and replay games:
- **Format**: Save click sequence and timestamps
- **Features**: Step through game replay, analyze decisions
- **Files**: `minesweeper/replay.py`

### 11. Multiple Window Support
Allow multiple game windows:
- **Implementation**: Separate game instances
- **Menu**: "New Window" option
- **Management**: Track all open games

### 12. Themes Support
Allow visual customization:
- **Themes**: Windows 95, Windows XP, Modern flat, Dark mode
- **Configuration**: Theme selection in settings
- **Structure**: `minesweeper/themes/` directory

## Technical Improvements üìã

### 13. Testing Suite
Add comprehensive tests:
- **Framework**: pytest
- **Coverage**: Game logic, edge cases, GUI components
- **Files**: `tests/` directory with unit tests
- **CI**: GitHub Actions for automated testing

### 14. Performance Optimization
Optimize for larger grids:
- **Large boards**: Ensure Expert mode (30x16) runs smoothly
- **Memory**: Optimize grid storage and updates
- **Rendering**: Only update changed cells

### 15. Error Handling
Improve error handling and recovery:
- **File I/O**: Better handling of settings/save file errors
- **GUI**: Graceful handling of display issues
- **Logging**: Add logging for debugging

### 16. Packaging and Distribution
Create distributable packages:
- **Windows**: PyInstaller executable
- **Linux**: AppImage or .deb package
- **macOS**: .app bundle
- **Cross-platform**: Consider using tools like briefcase

## Implementation Guide üõ†Ô∏è

### For AI Agents:
1. **Pick one feature** from Priority 1 to implement
2. **Read the existing code** to understand the structure
3. **Add tests first** if implementing new logic
4. **Make minimal changes** to existing working code
5. **Test thoroughly** on multiple difficulty levels
6. **Update documentation** as needed

### Code Style Guidelines:
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Add docstrings to all new functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Update imports only when necessary

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Game starts without errors
- [ ] All three difficulty levels work
- [ ] Left-click reveals cells correctly
- [ ] Right-click flags/unflags cells
- [ ] Game win/lose conditions trigger properly
- [ ] Timer counts correctly
- [ ] Mine counter updates properly
- [ ] Menu options work
- [ ] No crashes during normal gameplay

## File Templates üìÅ

### For new features, consider these file templates:

**New Dialog Template** (`minesweeper/gui/dialogs.py`):
```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk

class CustomGameDialog:
    def __init__(self, parent):
        self.result = None
        # Implementation here
```

**New Module Template**:
```python
"""
Module description.
"""

from typing import Optional, List
from ..game import MinesweeperGame

class NewFeature:
    """Class description."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```
